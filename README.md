# NoSA (No Springs Attached)
Calculates the normal modes of a multiple mass-spring system.

Checklist [physics]:-
  1. Build ConnectedSystem class which can add and remove masses and springs
  2. Working makefile
  3. Integrate Armadillo linear algebra package
  3. Build force matrix for example system and solve for eigenvalues and eigenvectors
  4. Consistency check with simple analytical case
